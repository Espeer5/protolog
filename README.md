# Protolog

Protolog is a logging utility for distributed or cross-platform systems that use Google's protobuf for communication between nodes. Protolog allows the user to simply write their proto out to a zmq logging socket which can be either IPC or TCP across nodes, and then get a full-featured log monitoring GUI for free.
